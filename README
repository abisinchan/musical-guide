Module 2 Challenge 1 05/31/23

## Description
My motivation behind this challlenge was to be able to demonstrate all the things I learned in Module 1(HTML) and 2(CSS). 
This project could not have been completed without being resourceful and using web docs, like MDN and youtube. 
The problem for this project was that this was new territory and we had to create a project from scratch.
I learned that there are different ways to approach a task and that there could be different paths, leading to the same outcome.
